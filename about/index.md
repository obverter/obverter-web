{% marginfigure 'about-ben-photo' 'assets/img/about-ben-photo.jpg' ''  %}I'm a writer, a data analyist, a small-biz Operations whiz, a Photoshop scoundrel, a burrito enthusiast, a weird-book worm, a sabermetrics goblin, and a not-terrible woodworker. Not necessarily in that order.

I'm an indiscriminate connoisseur of the Interesting, and I tend to write about not-depressing things.

For the last ten years I've been running a boutique environmental engineering firm, which specializes in facility design, process analysis, and issues that have the potential to transmogrify tools, people, and indeed entire buildings into ephemeral, outbound smithereens.

In that role, I've worked with hundreds of clients of every size, including three-letter agencies, Fortune 1 companies, garage-sized startups, Mom-and-Pop gas stations, and manufacturing facilities that were old when the world was young.

I've even worked with companies whose executives have gone on to e.g. implode large social media platforms, or who have defrauded biotech investors and since been sent to prison. How fun!

I'm a big fan of baseball history, weird books, and the Oxford Comma.

I live in the Bay Area with my dog{% sidenote "sidenote-one" "Kermit. His middle name is Danger." %} and his family.

<!-- The *Tufte-Jekyll* theme is a natural extension of the work done by [Edward Tufte](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) and his collaborators on Github who created a CSS file that allows web writers to use the same simple and elegant style employed in his published materials.

To incorporate these styles into a Jekyll theme, I have made some very slight modifications that attempt to maintain the feel of the CSS styles in his Github repo.

Note that this is a full-width layout. This was accomplished by including ```layout: full-width``` in the YAML front matter for this page. Keep in mind that all the Tufte-Jekyll sidenote and marginnote goodness will not work on full-width layouts!

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). -->
