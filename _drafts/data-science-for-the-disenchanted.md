---

You're a algebra aficionado who took some calculus in college but failed miserably. You may have given up on your math dreams, but that doesn't mean you have to give up on a data-driven career! Data science is for people like us: people who are passionate about finding answers, even if it means we have to work a little bit harder. Let me show you how data science can be your new favorite thing (even if math isn't).

## What is Data Science?

Data science is all about extracting meaning from data. It's a field that combines statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to make sense of large data sets. Data scientists analyze data to find trends and patterns that can be used to make better decisions.

## Why Data Science?

Data science is one of the hottest fields right now, and for good reason. The world is becoming more and more digital, which means there is an increasing amount of data being generated each day. According to IBM, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every day! That's a lot of 0s and 1s, and it's only going to continue to grow. As businesses become more reliant on data, the demand for data scientists will only increase.

## How Can I Be a Data Scientist?

If you're interested in pursuing a career in data science, the first step is to brush up on your math skills. I know, I knowâ€”you thought you were done with math after calculus. But trust me, it will be worth it! A strong foundation in math is essential for a successful career in data science. Once you've gotten yourmath skills up to par, you can begin learning programming languages like R and Python. These languages will allow you to manipulate data sets and run statistical analysis. Finally, you need to gain some domain expertise. This can be achieved through working in a specific industry or sector OR by completing a masters or PhD program in data science.

## Conclusion

Data science is a rapidly growing field with immense potential for those who are willing to put in the work. If you're interested in pursuing a career in data science, the first step is to brush up on your math skills. A strong foundation in math is essential for success in this field. Once you've gotten your math skills up to par, you can begin learning programming languages like R and Python. These languages will allow you to manipulate data sets and run statistical analysis. Finally, you need to gain some domain expertise; this can be achieved through working in a specific industry or sector OR by completing a masters or PhD program in data science.
