A human hand is the second-hardest thing to draw.
But only because the first-hardest is the other hand.

What I’m attempting to say is that the hands, separately and together, are the hardest things to draw.

There are all these fussy little bendy parts and bony bits, and everything’s covered in skin and sometimes hair.

Also: everyone on the planet knows exactly what a hand looks like, and it’s easy for anyone to notice even the smallest of errors or mistakes of proportion.

Except I guess for those who were born blind. But I’m not certain. I’ve seen a blind man ride a bicycle before, and the best living card mechanic hasn’t seen a thing since the age of thirteen.

But this is the consensus of the art community, basically. The difficulty level of drawing hands, thing — not the observation of the blind, pun intended.

Don’t dispute me.

Breaking it down, if you’re right-handed, your right hand is probably harder to draw because it’s gonna be busy drawing itself instead of being held up in front of your face for reference.

Mirror that if you’re a lefty.

But if you’re Neither Handed…?

Well, if you’re Neither Handed, then this is a bullshit thought experiment because nothing is difficult, and every purported challenge is little more than another merriment on the waterslide that is my life.

Unless, of course, we’re talking about drawing a hand accurately and/or precisely. If that’s the case, then kindly disregard the previous metaphor.

Moving along.

In 1993 Malcolm Gladwell published this mostly garbage theory that says it takes about 10,000 hours of intensive practice to master something.

(If you’re a Gladwell fan, I’m not here to yuck your yum. His sentiment is admirable, but the numbers do not grok)

So! I figure it’ll take me drawing about ten hundred hands to master hand-drawing to a mediocre level.

Are you starting to see what I mean about Gladwell?

Ten.

Hundred.

Hands.

There’s no way I’m spending ten hours on each hand.

Who’s got that kind of time?

Ten hundred hands is still like a million hands, though. I have no idea how long this will take.

If I were a betting person (and I am), I’d wager it’d take a veritable handful of weeks at minimum.

In any case, I’ve broken this trauma out into ten groups of a hundred hands because that sounds so much more palatable than a hundred groups of ten.

Think about it.

A hundred groups of ten hands is like 25 groups of 200 fingers, 40 palms, and hunks of enough skin to cover about six medium Domino’s Meat Lover’s pizzas.

Doesn’t that sound way more awful?

And I say “about ten hands” because I’m only going to be drawing intact hands here. No stumpy knuckles. No missing thumbs.

Not because I’ve got anything against people who’re missing fingers — and certainly not because I’m setting out to get the most out of this exercise.

Here’s a fun fact to brighten your day:

If you’ve got ten fingers, you’ve got an above-average number of fingers!

Maybe only infinitesimally more fingers than average, sure. But that’s what the math says.

Because all it takes is one drunk game of Table Saw Twister near Cleveland, or Hanoi, or Prague, or Cleveland, and the global average number of fingers per person drops below ten.

But getting back to the real reason:

In my corporeal life, I strive for empathy because I’m a softie; frugality, because  I need to hoard wealth for the forthcoming climate wars; and altruism because there’s no better way to ensure that everyone always owes you a favor.

But this is one case where I’ll be selfish and splurge.

See, I'm aware that this project will be neither fast nor easy.

It will be frustrating. I’ll cry three, potentially four times.

There will be days when I’ll want desperately to quit, and weeks when I do quit without telling anyone, and then start up again like nothing happened, and no one will ever know.

That’s why I want to afford myself every nicety. To keep myself lumbering along.

More carrot, less stick.

And so, I will use only above-average references.

Because I’m worth it.
