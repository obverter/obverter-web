title: Recursive Blog Posts Are Easier Than Originality
---

Coming up with ideas for a blog post can be tough. Trust me, I know. I mean, what are you supposed to write about? The sky? Your dog? That one time you saw a strange man walking down the street eating a banana? (True story, by the way. Don't ask.)

There are only so many topics in the world, and sometimes it feels like they've all been covered. So what do you do when you can't think of anything to write? Well, you could always write about how difficult it is to come up with something to write about. Problem solved!

## Why Is It So Hard to Come Up with Blog Topics?

There are a few reasons why coming up with blog topics can be such a pain. For one thing, there's the pressure to be original. With billions of people in the world and platforms like Instagram and Twitter where anyone can share their voice with the click of a button, it can feel like everything's been said before.

Then there's the pressure to be interesting. No one wants to read a boring blog post (except for maybe my grandma—hi, Grandma!). But seriously, who wants to read a snooze-fest of a post when there are cats falling off kitchen tables and dogs wearing shoes all over the internet? The bar is pretty high these days when it comes to what people will find interesting enough to read or watch.

And then there are the Voice Police. No, not the kind that show up at 2 in the morning with bullhorns and megaphones because someone's throwing a party. I'm talking about that little voice in your head that says things like "That's not good enough" or "No one will care about this" or "This is stupid." The Voice Police can be pretty darn convincing sometimes—and they're not above making deals like, "If you don't post anything today, you can have an extra piece of cake."

## Conclusion

So there you have it: why coming up with blog topics can be tough and what you can do about it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go eat that extra piece of cake...after I think of something else to write about, of course.
