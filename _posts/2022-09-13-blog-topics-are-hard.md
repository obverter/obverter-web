title: Recursive Blog Posts Are Easier Than Originality
---

Coming up with ideas for a blog post can be tough. I mean, what are you supposed to write about? The sky? Your dog? Coming up with ideas for blog posts? That's not a bad idea, actually.

I mean let's be real: there are only so many topics in the world, and sometimes it feels like they've all been covered. So what do you do when you can't think of anything to write? Well, you could always write about how difficult it is to come up with something to write about. Crisis averted!

## Why Is It So Hard to Come Up with Blog Topics?

There are a few reasons why coming up with blog topics can be such a pain. For one thing, there's the pressure to be original. With billions of people in the world and platforms like Instagram and Twitter where anyone can share their voice with the click of a button, it can feel like everything's been said before.

Then there's the pressure to be interesting. No one wants to read a boring blog post, and in today's environment of fast-paced, fickle attention spans, the bar is pretty high when it comes to what people will find interesting enough to read or watch.

And then there are the Voice Police. No, not the kind that show up at 2 in the morning with bullhorns and megaphones because someone's throwing a party, and I'm not talking about getting cancelled. I'm talking about that little voice in your head that says things like "That's not good enough" or "No one will care about this" or "This is stupid." The Voice Police can be pretty darn convincing sometimesâ€”and for good reason.

Everything is stupid, and most of what you write isn't good enough, and people don't think about you nearly as often as you think or worry that they do.

But that's the silver bullet.

Everything is stupid. Nothing is ever good enough. Nobody cares.

## So Do Whatever You Want

Coming up with blog topics is impossible. But so is putting yourself out there. All of your articles are terrible, but they're still your articles. And that's not nothing.
