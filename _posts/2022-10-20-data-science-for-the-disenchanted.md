title: Data Science for the Disenchanted
---

Just because you may have given up on your childhood dreams of winning a Fields Medal, that doesn't mean you have to give up on a data-driven career. Data science is for folks like us: people who can calculate a restaurant tip without crying, and who are passionate about finding answers that aren't already on Wikipedia.

## What is Data Science?

Data science is all about extracting meaning from data. It's a field that combines statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to make sense of large data sets. Data scientists analyze data to find trends and patterns that can be used to make better decisions.

## Why Data Science?

Data science is one of the hottest fields right now, and for good reason. The world is becoming more and more digital, which means there is an increasing amount of data being generated each day. According to IBM, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every day! That's a lot of 0s and 1s, and it's only going to continue to grow. As businesses become more reliant on data, the demand for data scientists will only increase.

## What's the Best Way to Become a Data Scientist?

If you're interested in pursuing a career in data science, the best way to start is to brush up on your math skills. I know, I know—you thought you were done with math after calculus. But trust me, it will be worth it! A strong foundation in math is essential for a successful career in data science. Once you've gotten your math skills up to par, you can begin learning programming languages like R and Python. These languages will allow you to manipulate data sets and run statistical analysis. Finally, you need to gain some domain expertise. This can be achieved through working in a specific industry or sector OR by completing a masters or PhD program in data science.

## What If I Don't Want to Do Any of That?

Like many disenchanted millennials, disillusioned Gen-Xers, disabused Zoomers, and dispeptic Boomers, you may be feeling a little discouraged these days. Maybe you're struggling to find your place in the workforce, or pay off your student loans. Maybe it's time for a career change. Or maybe you've just always wanted to learn how to computer like the hackers on NCIS.

And so you Google around, and you find all sorts of articles like this one that say that all you have to do is dedicate the next few years of your life to a curriculum, and then you'll be ready to get started.

Soon, you start feeling like a fraud—like you're not smart or talented enough for the field. Don't worry - you're not alone. This feeling is known as imposter syndrome and it's actually a good thing. In fact, if you don't have it, you're probably not trying hard enough.

## Fake It 'Til You're Fired

Guess what? Nobody knows what they're doing, and everyone feels like an imposter. The sooner you can embrace this, the easier it'll be for you to get started. So long as you don't set anything on fire or habitually over-promise and under-deliver, you'll be fine.

## Where Do I Start?

### [Get Yourself a Fancy GitHub](https://jonathansoma.com/fancy-github/)

Sooner or later, you'll need a GitHub profile. {% marginnote 'mn-1' 'Do yourself a favor and Google Jonathan Soma. He's got about fifty different websites and walkthroughs re: getting started in Data Science, and his stuff is mostly geared around journalists who don't already have a strong technical background.' %} GitHub is invaluable when working in the field, but looking like you have your shit together on GitHub is just as important. And not just because it's important for people to be able to see that it looks like you know what you're doing.

Getting a GitHub profile organized requires becoming familiar with common, language-agnostic best practices. If you can get a not-hideous GitHub profile up, you're in good shape to start learning how to start sifting through data.

### Choose a Miniature Project

And then do it. Start in Excel if you need to. Find a question that doesn't have a readily available answer, but for which you've got access to a lot of free data. What's the weather like where you were born? How have average annual temperatures changed there while you've been alive?

Start with something that small. Find some numbers, moosh them around, write it up, and put it online. It doesn't matter if the entire article comprises a 2x3 table and a one paragraph writeup. Just do it.

And then do it again, and again, and again, forever.

## But Nobody on NCIS Uses Excel

Look, data science is a rapidly growing field with immense potential for those who are willing to put in the work. And the work involves nothing more than learning how to investigate questions that you don't know how to investigate. Programming languages like R and Python are probably going to end up in your toolbox at some point, since these languages will allow you to manipulate data sets and run statistical analysis. But nobody needs to start with those.

## Experience the Domain

You need to gain some domain expertise, but this doesn't mean you've gotta go get a masters. Almost everything you need can be achieved through executing personal projects and pushing your own boundaries. Make it a point to incorporate some new tool or technique in every project.

And put it online, coward. Most people are empathetic and like to see people put themselves out there. And everyone else is a total waste of your time.

Why worry about everyone liking you when you don't even like everyone?
