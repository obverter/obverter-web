{% marginfigure 'about-ben-photo' 'assets/img/about-ben-photo.jpg' 'Kermit and his Ben'  %}I'm a writer, a data analyist, a small-biz Operations whiz, a Photoshop scoundrel, a burrito enthusiast, a weird-book worm, a garbage disposal for trivia, a baseball goblin, and a woodworker. Not necessarily in that order.


I'm an indiscriminate connoisseur of the Interesting, and I tend to write data-driven words about not-depressing things.

That is, whenever I'm not producing content about my misadventures in creating content, or my tribulations and triumphs re: making physical stuff.

I live in the Bay Area with my dog and his family.

<!-- The *Tufte-Jekyll* theme is a natural extension of the work done by [Edward Tufte](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) and his collaborators on Github who created a CSS file that allows web writers to use the same simple and elegant style employed in his published materials.

To incorporate these styles into a Jekyll theme, I have made some very slight modifications that attempt to maintain the feel of the CSS styles in his Github repo.

Note that this is a full-width layout. This was accomplished by including ```layout: full-width``` in the YAML front matter for this page. Keep in mind that all the Tufte-Jekyll sidenote and marginnote goodness will not work on full-width layouts!

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). -->
